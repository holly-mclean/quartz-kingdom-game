# Quartz Kingdom
A text-based fantasy adventure game. This was my final project for CS162.

## Getting Started
The makefile provided should take care of compiling and cleaning. Once files are downloaded, use: 

```
make
```

And then:

```
./quartzkingdom
```

### Prerequisites
You'll need g++ to compile the files.

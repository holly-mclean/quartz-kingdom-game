** Date: August 2017
** Description: Function definitions for Gardens class. The Gardens contain an
optional collectible that will provide different endings. To get to the item,
the player has to have a password ("Penelope") to type in correctly. The
password can be found in the Grounds space.

Function that handles player's menu choices. If the player goes through the
maze, they have the option of trying to enter a password to unlock a gate. If
they succeed, the gate contains a unicorn item, which is not required to win
the game but provides different endings. The player also loses more time than
usual by going through the maze. This function uses both the array parameter
(if the player succeeds in opening the gate) and the stepPtr parameter (for
decreasing the clock by an additional 10 points each time they go through the
hedge maze).
